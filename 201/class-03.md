The HTML tag defines an unordered (bulleted) list. An unordered list starts with the tag. Each list item starts with the tag. The CSS list-style-type property is used to define the style of the list item marker.

-When should you use an ordered list vs an unorder list in your HTML document?
 The ordered list is the order of lists like 1,2,3. It is used to display an order of steps in HTML. To create the order list, we should use the <ol> tag in HTML. It is paired tag and it is a block level tag. If you create an ordered list only and give some text inside it, the list number doesnâ€™t display, so you have to give text inside the List item. To create a list item to the order list, we have to use a tag called as <li>.
<li> tag is used to add the list items to any list. By default order list type is set to a decimal number system. You can add many list items in the order list, it will display automatically in ascending order as in the above output.
