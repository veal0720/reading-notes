## Saving Changes

- All files in a checked out (or working) copy of a project file are either in a tracked or untracked state.

- Tracked

- Tracked files can be modified, unmodified, or staged; they were part of the most recent file snapshot.

- Untracked

- Untracked files were not in the last snapshot and do not currently reside in the staging area.

- *After cloning a repository, files have tracked status and are unmodified because they have been checked out but not edited.
