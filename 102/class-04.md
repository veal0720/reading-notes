# Class Four

The main parts of our element are as follows:

```js

//** The opening tag: This consists of the name of the element (in this case, p), wrapped in opening and closing angle brackets. This states where the element begins or starts to take effect — in this case where the paragraph begins.The closing tag: This is the same as the opening tag, except that it includes a forward slash before the element name. This states where the element ends — in this case where the paragraph ends. Failing to add a closing tag is one of the standard beginner errors and can lead to strange results.The content: This is the content of the element, which in this case, is just text.The element: The opening tag, the closing tag, and the content together comprise the element. */
